SET:

The Set is a non-indexed sequence.
The set doesnâ€™t allow duplicate elements.
Position access to elements is not allowed.
Null elements can store only once.

HashSet:

HashSet implements the Set interface 
No Duplicates are allowed.
Dummy values are allowed in HashSet.
HashSet is not Synchronized .

TreeSet:
Maintains ascending order.
Duplicate elements are not allowed.
In TreeSet all the elements remain in the sorted order.
Easy to find Smallest and largest value.

LinkedHashSet:
Maintains the insertion order.
It allows null element.
It is non-synchronized.
High memory as it maintains the insertion order.
Slower than HashSet if elements are more.

NavigableSet:

It is an interface that extends SortedSet.
It provides navigation methods like lower, floor, ceiling, higher etc.
It inherits the complexity of SortedSet.
