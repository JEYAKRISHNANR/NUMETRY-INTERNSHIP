REST API

   1.it is a collections of URLs, which is available on the server
   2.Each URL is call it as REST endpoint.
   3.Each REST endpoint performs a certain operation.
   4.Each REST endpoint also contains a HTTP method. 

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) :-

   1.foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load webpages using hypertext links.
   2.Mostly used in enterprise application it is servlet used to go from one page to another.
   3.it has mainly two methods GET and POST both has its own advantages one will show data in url 
   and one will not show data in url. 

HTTP METHODS 

   1.GET- Fetch the data from the server
   2.POST- Create a data in the Server
   3.PUT-Update a data in the server
   4.DELETE- Delete a data from the server

For HTTP POST AND PUT methods, we pass the data in Request Body.

DATA FORMAT:

   1.We will use json data format to communicate with REST API
   2.JSON is the most widely used dataformat
   3.We send the json data in Request Body and it will return the json response


JSON:
   JSON-Javascript Object Notation.
   1.it contains key and value pairs
   2.The key will always be in String but value could be anything
   3.String ,Number ,Boolean and Object etc.

     "name":"john",
     "age":31,
     "city":"New York"
    }


BASE URL:

 1.URI design in RESTful APIs involves creating resource identifiers
  that are intuitive, hierarchical, and consistent. Here's an
  example of URI design in a Spring Boot RESTful API:


-Learn the basics of setting up projects, configuring routes/endpoints, 
 and handling requests and responses.

-Practice handling different types of requests, validating inputs, 
 and returning appropriate responses.
