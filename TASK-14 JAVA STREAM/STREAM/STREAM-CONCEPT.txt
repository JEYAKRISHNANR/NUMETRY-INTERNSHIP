ByteArrayInputStream:

-it can be used to read byte array as input stream.
-Java ByteArrayInputStream class contains an internal
buffer which is used to read byte array as stream. 
In this stream, the data is read from a byte array.

ByteArrayOutputStream:

-The ByteArrayOutputStream holds a copy of data and forwards it to multiple streams.
-The default size of the buffer is 32 bytes and automatically increases as data is written into it.
-Closing this stream after use has no effect as its methods can be called even after closing it without producing any IOException.


DataInputStream:

-DataInputStream used to read primitive data types from an input source.
Commonly used methods of DataInputStream-readBooolean(),readByte(),readShort(),readInt()


DataOutputStream:

-Java DataOutputStream class allows an application to write primitive Java data types
to the output stream in a machine-independent way.

-Java application generally uses the data output stream to write data that can later 
be read by a data input stream.
