BufferedInputStream:

-The BufferedInputStream class reads data from a stream and uses an internal buffer to store the bytes of data to be read or skipped. 
-This internal buffer array is created along with the BufferedInputStream. The size of the internal buffer is approximately 8192 bytes.

BufferedOutputStream
-This class implements a buffered output stream that can be used to write bytes to the underlying output stream without making unnecessary 
calls to the underlying system for each byte. Like BufferedInputStream, it also maintains an internal buffer of 8192 bytes.


InputStream − This is used to read (sequential) data from a source.
-This class reads the data from a specific file (byte by byte). It is usually used to read the contents of a file with raw bytes

OutputStream − This is used to write data to a destination.
-This writes data into a specific file or, file descriptor (byte by byte). It is usually used to write the contents of a file with raw bytes
